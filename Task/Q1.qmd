# **The Source**

The task is taken from the [VAST Challenge 2024](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2024/). Questions from [Mini Case 3: Temporal Analysis](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2024/MC3.html) will be completed.

# Challenge Overview

![](data/Oceanus%20Information/Oceanus%20Geography.png){width="308"}

Welcome to Oceanus, an island nation with a healthy market for commercial fishing. Most companies in the region are united in following regulations and implementing sustainable fishing practices. But there are a few companies who are willing to cross ethical lines to increase their catch and their profits. Luckily, FishEye International maintains a watchful eye on fishing data. Their dedicated analysts have been processing data from various sources into a knowledge graph that they call CatchNet: the Oceanus Knowledge Graph.

# **The Task**

![](images/clipboard-587959097.png){width="320"}

Mini-challenge 3 concerns visualizing changes in business relationships within the commercial fishing industry. FishEye wants to understand how companies react to the closure of a competitor caught fishing illegally and how these changes affect influence networks. Design visualizations to show these changes over time and identify companies that may benefit from illegal fishing

Apply appropriate visual analytics methods to help FishEye, a non-profit organization that focuses on illegal fishing, to better identify bias, track behavior changes, and infer temporal patterns from the knowledge graphs prepared by their data analysts.

This take home exercise is done in conjunction with the group project. My group members are [Keke](https://isss608keke.netlify.app/) and [Quek You Ting](https://isss608ytquek.netlify.app/).

## Background

The business community in Oceanus is dynamic with new startups, mergers, acquisitions, and investments. FishEye International closely watches business records to keep tabs on commercial fishing operators. FishEye’s goal is to identify and prevent illegal fishing in the region’s sensitive marine ecosystem. Analysts are working with company records that show ownership, shareholders, transactions, and information about the typical products and services of each entity. FishEye’s analysts have a hybrid automated/manual process to transform the data into CatchNet: the Oceanus Knowledge Graph.

In the past year, Oceanus’s commercial fishing business community was rocked by the news that SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught fishing illegally. FishEye wants to understand temporal patterns and infer what may be happening in Oceanus’s fishing marketplace because of SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal behavior and eventual closure. The competitive nature of Oceanus’s fishing market may cause some businesses to react aggressively to capture SouthSeafood Express Corp’s business while other reactions may come from the awareness that illegal fishing does not go undetected and unpunished.

## Tasks and Questions:

A key element in stopping illegal fishing is holding the people who own nefarious companies accountable. Thus, FishEye is keenly interested in developing visualization tools that work with CatchNet to identify the people who hold influence over business networks. That is especially difficult with varied and changing shareholder and ownership relationships.

1.  FishEye analysts want to better visualize changes in corporate structures over time. Create a visual analytics approach that analysts can use to highlight temporal patterns and changes in corporate structures. Examine the most active people and businesses using visual analytics.

Note: the VAST challenge is focused on visual analytics and graphical figures should be included with your response to each question. Please include a reasonable number of figures for each question (no more than about 6) and keep written responses as brief as possible (around 250 words per question). Participants are encouraged to new visual representations rather than relying on traditional or existing approaches.

# Getting Started

## Installing and loading the required libraries

Note: Ensure that the [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/) package has already been installed.

The following R packages will be used:

-   tidytext

-   tidyverse

-   readtext

-   quanteda

-   jsonlite

-   igraph

-   tidygraph

-   ggraph

-   visNetwork

-   [clock](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clock/index.html)

-   graphlayouts

-   plotly

-   ggiraph

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidytext, readtext, quanteda, tidyverse, jsonlite, igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, visNetwork, clock, graphlayouts,plotly,ggiraph)
```

## **Importing JSON File**

Direct import of the mc3.json file shows an error message indicating that there's an invalid character in the JSON text, specifically "NaN". As "NaN" is not recognised as a valid value, preprocessing of the JSON file to replace "NaN" is required.

In the code chunk below, *mc3.json* is first imported, then all instances of "NaN" are replaced with "null", and the processed file is written into a json file *mc3_fixed.json* for later use.

```{r}
# Read the JSON file as text
json_text <- readLines("data/mc3.json")

# Replace "NaN" with "null"
json_text_fixed <- gsub("NaN", "null", json_text)

# Write the fixed JSON text back to a file
writeLines(json_text_fixed, "data/mc3_fixed.json")
```

Importing preprocessed mc3_fixed.json file

```{r}
mc3_data <- fromJSON("data/mc3_fixed.json")
```

View dataframe

-   Similar info as shown above

```{r}
glimpse(mc3_data)
```

::: callout-note
mc3_date\[\["nodes"\]\] dataframe contains 15 columns and 60520 rows.

mc3_date\[\["links"\]\] dataframe contains 11 columns and 75817 rows.
:::

::: callout-note
On closer inspection of `mc3_data`, we note some issues to be rectified:

1.  Columns containing dates are treated as “Character” data type instead of *date* data type, which is incorrect. Thus, the data type of the following fields need to be changed to “Date”” data type:
    -   founding_date
    -   \_last_edited_date
    -   \_date_added
    -   start_date
    -   \_last_edited_date
    -   \_date_added
    -   dob
2.  Some columns have missing values, which need to be handled appropriately for ease of later analysis.
3.  Some columns are prefixed with "\_", we remove them to reduce chance of bugs later
:::

## Missing Values

Identify the percentage of missing values within the dataset

```{r}
# Function to calculate missing value percentages
calculate_missing_percentage <- function(df) {
  total_values <- nrow(df) * ncol(df)
  missing_values <- sum(is.na(df))
  missing_percentage <- (missing_values / total_values) * 100
  return(missing_percentage)
}
```

::: panel-tabset
## Nodes

```{r}
nodes_missing_percentage <- calculate_missing_percentage(mc3_data[["nodes"]])
nodes_missing_percentage

nodes_missing_by_column <- sapply(mc3_data[["nodes"]], function(x) sum(is.na(x)) / length(x) * 100)
nodes_missing_by_column
```

## Links

```{r}
links_missing_percentage <- calculate_missing_percentage(mc3_data[["links"]])
links_missing_percentage

links_missing_by_column <- sapply(mc3_data[["links"]], function(x) sum(is.na(x)) / length(x) * 100)
links_missing_by_column
```
:::

::: callout-note
Nodes: Overall, there are 35.12% missing values. While most columns have no missing values, the majority of those with missing data pertain to optional attributes:

-   ProductServices (Optional) - 85.34%

-   PointOfContact (Optional)- 85.38%

-   HeadofOrg (Optional) - 85.36%

-   founding_date - 85.34%

-   revenue (Optional) - 85.37%

-   TradeDescription (Optional) - 85.34%

-   dob - 14.66%

Links: Overall, there are 9.06% missing values. Most of the columns do not contain missing values, except for:

-   start_date - 0.12%

-   end_date (Optional) - 99.54%

In addition, according to the *VAST2024 - MC3 Data Description* file, all empty values in the revenue column are supposed to have been set to 0. However, there are still some values with "NA".
:::

## Setting empty values in *`revenue`* to 0

Set NA values to 0 to aid analysis

```{r}
# Create a copy of mc3_data
mc3_data2 <- mc3_data

# Set empty values in revenue to 0 and save it to the new list
mc3_data2$nodes$revenue <- ifelse(is.na(mc3_data2$nodes$revenue) | mc3_data2$nodes$revenue == "", 0, mc3_data2$nodes$revenue)
```

Verify changes

```{r}
# ensure no more missing values in revenue column
sum(is.na(mc3_data2$nodes$revenue))
```

## Rename Columns

Remove prefix "\_" from columns to reduce chance of issues later

```{r}
# Function to remove leading underscores from column names
remove_leading_underscores <- function(df) {
  colnames(df) <- gsub("^_", "", colnames(df))
  return(df)
}

# Create a copy of mc3_data2 and name it mc3_data3
mc3_data3 <- mc3_data2

# Apply the function to the nodes and links data frames in mc3_data3
mc3_data3$nodes <- remove_leading_underscores(mc3_data3$nodes)
mc3_data3$links <- remove_leading_underscores(mc3_data3$links)
```

Verify changes

```{r}
colnames(mc3_data3$nodes)
colnames(mc3_data3$links)
```

## Standardising Date Time Formats

In preparation for temporal analysis

```{r}

# Create a copy of mc3_data3 and name it mc3_data4
mc3_data4 <- mc3_data3

# Convert date columns to Date-Time type
mc3_data4$nodes <- mc3_data4$nodes %>%
  mutate(
    founding_date = ymd_hms(founding_date),
    last_edited_date = ymd_hms(last_edited_date),
    date_added = ymd_hms(date_added),
    dob = ymd_hms(dob)
  )

mc3_data4$links <- mc3_data4$links %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = ymd_hms(start_date),
    last_edited_date = ymd_hms(last_edited_date),
    date_added = ymd_hms(date_added),
    end_date = ymd_hms(end_date)
  )
```

::: callout-note
The `ymd_hms` function is designed to work with character vectors and will return `NA` for any existing `NA` values. This means that any `NA` value in the original columns will remain `NA` after the conversion.
:::

Verify changes

```{r}
# View the first few rows of the date columns in nodes
head(mc3_data4$nodes %>% select(founding_date, last_edited_date, date_added, dob))

# View the first few rows of the date columns in links
head(mc3_data4$links %>% select(start_date))

# Summary of date columns in nodes
summary(mc3_data4$nodes %>% select(founding_date, last_edited_date, date_added, dob))

# Summary of date columns in links
summary(mc3_data4$links %>% select(start_date))

# Check the types of the date columns in nodes
str(mc3_data4$nodes %>% select(founding_date, last_edited_date, date_added, dob))

# Check the types of the date columns in links
str(mc3_data4$links %>% select(start_date))
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
view(mc3_data4[["nodes"]])
view(mc3_data4[["links"]])
```

## Split Words

The steps below will be used to split text in type column of **nodes** into two columns: namely type1 and type2.

```{r}
# Make a copy of mc3_data4
mc3_data5 <- mc3_data4

# Split the type column into two columns
mc3_data5$nodes <- mc3_data5$nodes %>%
  mutate(
    type1 = sub("^(\\S+).*", "\\1", type),
    type2 = sub("^\\S+\\.(.*)", "\\1", type)
  )

# If there's only one word in type, set type2 to NA
mc3_data5$nodes$type2 <- ifelse(grepl("\\.", mc3_data5$nodes$type), mc3_data5$nodes$type2, NA)

# Remove the original 'type' column
mc3_data5$nodes <- mc3_data5$nodes %>%
  select(-type)

```

The steps below will be used to split text in type column of **links** into two columns: namely type1 and type2.

```{r}
# Make a copy of mc3_data4
mc3_data6 <- mc3_data5

# Split the type column into two columns
# There are no special cases, exception left blank
mc3_data6$links <- mc3_data6$links %>%
  mutate(
    type1 = sub("(.*?\\..*?)(\\.[^.]+)?$", "\\1", type),
    type2 = ifelse(grepl("\\.", type), sub(".*\\.", "", type), "")
  )

# remove the original 'type' column
mc3_data6$links <- mc3_data6$links %>%
  select(-type)
```

Verify changes

```{r}
# View the first few rows of the type columns in nodes
head(mc3_data6$nodes %>% select(type1,type2))

# View the first few rows of the type columns in links
head(mc3_data6$links %>% select(type1,type2))
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
view(mc3_data6[["nodes"]])
view(mc3_data6[["links"]])
```

## Extract Nodes

For Question 1

```{r}
#keep only necessary columns
mc3_nodes_1 <- as_tibble(mc3_data6$nodes) %>%
  select (-TradeDescription,
          -last_edited_by,
          -last_edited_date,
          -algorithm,
          -dob,
          -type1)
```

Save as rds file for future use

```{r}
write_rds(mc3_nodes_1, "data/rds/mc3_nodes_1.rds")
```

## Extract Links

For Question 1

```{r}
mc3_links_1 <- as_tibble(mc3_data6$links) %>%
  select (-last_edited_by,
          -last_edited_date,
          -date_added,
          -key,
          -algorithm,
          -type1,
          -end_date)
```

Save as rds file for future use

```{r}
write_rds(mc3_links_1, "data/rds/mc3_links_1.rds")
```

# Load Data

Load rds file

Note: rds files can be loaded independently of the data wrangling steps above to save time

```{r,eval=FALSE}
mc3_links_1 <- readRDS("data/rds/mc3_links_1.rds")
mc3_nodes_1 <- readRDS("data/rds/mc3_nodes_1.rds")
```

# Changes in Corporate Structures Over Time

The plot shows how transaction volume changes over time, which helps identify periods of increased or decreased activity

```{r}
transactions_over_time <- mc3_links_1 %>%
  group_by(start_date) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  drop_na()
```

## Number of Transactions over Time

Number of links can be used to determine transactions over time

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(transactions_over_time, aes(x = start_date, y = count)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Transactions Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Number of Transactions")
```

## Code

```{r,eval=FALSE}
ggplot(transactions_over_time, aes(x = start_date, y = count)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Transactions Over Time", x = "Date", y = "Number of Transactions")
```
:::

::: callout-note
The dataset spans from year 1952 to 2035.

We can see that from the start of the dataset until about year 2000, there were relatively few transactions. There was a small spike after year 2000, proceeded by exponential growth around 2005. However, there was a dip in transactions in 2035.

The dip could be due to effects after SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught for illegal behaviour and eventually closed in 2035.

Analysis should focus on transactions from year 2005 onwards. Data analysed should also be aggregated by year.
:::

### Filter data

Filter data to only keep transactions from 2000 (5 years before 2005) to 2035 (end of dataset). We keep some data that occurs before the start of our period of interest to capture any recent changes to entities.

```{r}
# Filter the data frames to keep only data from the year 2000 and onwards
mc3_links_1_filtered <- mc3_links_1 %>%
  filter(start_date >= as.Date("2000-01-01"))
```

### Aggregate Data by Year

```{r}
# Extract year for aggregation
mc3_links_1_filtered2 <- mc3_links_1_filtered %>%
  mutate(transaction_year = year(start_date))

# Calculate the number of transactions per year
yearly_txns <- mc3_links_1_filtered2 %>%
  group_by(transaction_year) %>%
  summarise(num_transactions = n())
```

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r,echo=FALSE}

# Plot the number of transactions per year
ggplot(yearly_txns, aes(x = transaction_year, y = num_transactions)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Transactions Per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Transactions") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Code

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Plot the number of transactions per year
ggplot(yearly_txns, aes(x = transaction_year, y = num_transactions)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Transactions Per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Transactions") +
  theme_minimal()
```
:::

::: callout-note
It is now clearer that the rapid growth in transactions started around 2005, before reaching its peak at 2034 and sharply dropping in 2035, likely due to after effects of the SouthSeafood Express Corp incident.
:::

## Number of Active Companies Per Year

Drop na values

```{r}
mc3_nodes2_1 <- mc3_nodes_1 %>%
  drop_na(founding_date) # removes Persons and Persons CEO
```

Number of nodes can be used to determine the number of active companies per year.

```{r}
# Extract year for aggregation
mc3_nodes3_1 <- mc3_nodes2_1 %>%
  mutate(active_year = floor_date(founding_date, "year"))

# Calculate the number of active companies per year
active_companies <- mc3_nodes3_1 %>%
  group_by(active_year) %>%
  summarise(num_active_companies = n())
```

Summary

```{r}
# Calculate the summary statistics
summary_stats <- summary(active_companies$num_active_companies)
summary_stats

# Extract and save the mean
# Round to 2 decimal places
mean_active_companies <- round(summary_stats["Mean"], 2)
```

Plot graph

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Plot the number of active companies over time
ggplot(active_companies, aes(x = active_year, y = num_active_companies)) +
  # line plot
  geom_line(color = "darkgreen") +
  labs(title = "Number of Active Companies Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of Active Companies") +
  # mean line
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean_active_companies), 
             linetype = "dotted", color = "blue") +
  annotate("text", x = min(active_companies$active_year), 
           y = mean_active_companies, 
           label = paste("Mean:", mean_active_companies), 
           hjust = 0, vjust = -1, color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Code

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Plot the number of active companies over time
ggplot(active_companies, aes(x = active_year, y = num_active_companies)) +
  # line plot
  geom_line(color = "darkgreen") +
  labs(title = "Number of Active Companies Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of Active Companies") +
  # mean line
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean_active_companies), 
             linetype = "dotted", color = "blue") +
  annotate("text", x = min(active_companies$active_year), 
           y = mean_active_companies, 
           label = paste("Mean:", mean_active_companies), 
           hjust = 0, vjust = -1, color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()

```
:::

::: callout-note
While there are fluctuations in the number of active companies over time, there is generally an increasing trend of the number of active companies over time, especially around 2010 onwards. This period shows a rising trend with the number of active companies reaching the highest values in the dataset. This is similar to that observed in the number of transactions over time, seen above.

We also see a dip around 2035, before the numbers increase again. Also likely due to the after effects of the SouthSeafood Express Corp incident.

## Centrality Measures

### **Modifying network nodes and edges**

Prepare the **`edges`** dataframe for network analysis by:

-   Ensuring all edges are unique.

-   Converting columns to a uniform type.

-   Calculating the weight of each edge (how many times each connection occurs).

-   Removing any self-loops.

```{r}
mc3_edges <-
  as_tibble(mc3_links_1_filtered2) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(source = as.character(source),
         target = as.character(target),
         type = as.character(type2),
         tyear = as.integer(transaction_year)) %>%
  group_by(source, target, type,tyear) %>%
  summarise(weights = n()) %>%
  filter(source != target) %>%
  ungroup()
```

::: callout-note
The resulting **`mc3_edges`** tibble contains the columns **`source`**, **`target`**, **`type`**, **`year`**, and **`weights`**, where each row represents a unique edge between two nodes with a specific type, and the **`weights`** column represents the number of times that edge occurs.
:::

Clean and preprocess the **`nodes`** data by:

-   Ensuring that each column has the correct data type for analysis.

-   Selecting only the necessary columns for further analysis or visualization.

```{r}
mc3_nodes <- as_tibble(mc3_nodes_1) %>%
  mutate(country = as.character(country), 
         id = as.character(id), 
         ProductServices = as.character(ProductServices), 
         revenue = as.numeric(as.character(revenue)), 
         type = as.character(type2)) %>%
  select(id, country, type, revenue, ProductServices)
```

::: callout-note
The resulting **`mc3_nodes`** tibble contains the cleaned and correctly typed columns **`id`**, **`country`**, **`type`**, **`revenue`**, and **`ProductServices`**.
:::

### Keeping unique values

Edges

```{r}
unique_transaction_types_edges <- mc3_edges %>%
  select(type) %>%
  distinct()

# Display the unique transaction types
print(unique_transaction_types_edges)
```

::: callout-note
There are 4 types of edges, namely:

-   Shareholdership

-   WorksFor

-   BeneficialOwnership

-   FamilyRelationship
:::

Nodes

```{r}
unique_transaction_types_nodes <- mc3_nodes %>%
  select(type) %>%
  distinct()

# Display the unique transaction types
print(unique_transaction_types_nodes)
```

::: callout-note
There are 8 types of nodes, namely:

-   Company

-   LogisticsCompany

-   FishingCompany

-   FinancialCompany

-   NewsCompany

-   NGO

-   Person

-   CEO
:::

### Extract all the source and target nodes

Extract all the source and target nodes, then, drop any unmatched nodes

```{r}
id1 <- mc3_edges %>%
  select(source) %>%
  rename(id = source)

id2 <- mc3_edges %>%
  select(target) %>%
  rename(id = target)

mc3_nodes1 <- rbind(id1, id2) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  left_join(mc3_nodes, by = c("id" = "id")) %>%
  mutate(unmatched = "drop")
```

Verify results

```{r}
print(mc3_nodes1)
```

### Create Graph Object

Create graph object and calculate centrality measures

```{r,collapse=TRUE}
mc3_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = mc3_nodes1, edges = mc3_edges, directed = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness(),
         closeness_centrality = centrality_closeness())
  theme_graph()
```

### Network Graph

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Display the network graph
ggraph(mc3_graph, layout = "fr") + # Using Fruchterman-Reingold layout
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = 0.9, edge_width = 0.1)) + # Customize edge appearance
  geom_node_point(aes(size = betweenness_centrality, color = closeness_centrality)) + # Customize node appearance
  scale_color_viridis_c() + # Use viridis color scale
  theme_void() + # Use a void theme
  labs(title = "Network Graph of Business Network",
       subtitle = "Nodes colored by closeness centrality and sized by betweenness centrality",
       caption = "Data Source: mc3.json") # Add titles and captions
```

## Code

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Display the network graph
ggraph(mc3_graph, layout = "fr") + # Using Fruchterman-Reingold layout
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = 0.8, edge_width = 0.8)) + # Customize edge appearance
  geom_node_point(aes(size = betweenness_centrality, color = closeness_centrality)) + # Customize node appearance
  scale_color_viridis_c() + # Use viridis color scale
  theme_void() + # Use a void theme
  labs(title = "Refined Network Graph of Atypical Business Transactions",
       subtitle = "Nodes colored by closeness centrality and sized by betweenness centrality",
       caption = "Data Source: mc3.json") # Add titles and captions
```
:::

::: callout-note
The grey circular portion in the center of the network graph does not represent any specific data or entities. It is a visual byproduct resulting from the dense clustering of nodes and edges in that central region. This effect is particularly noticeable in dense, highly interconnected network visualizations where nodes and edges are concentrated in a small space.

Thus, we filter the nodes to refine the graph.
:::

### Refined Network Graph

#### Top Nodes

Identify top 20 nodes by betweenness centrality

```{r}
# Identify top nodes by betweenness centrality
top_nodes <- mc3_graph %>%

It is likely that these entities on the top 10 list are big players in the industry and control information and resources.

High betweenness centrality means that a node plays a more crucial role in connecting other nodes. It can be an indicator of:

-   **Brokerage Role**: Nodes with high betweenness centrality often act as bridges or intermediaries between different parts of the network. They control the flow of information, resources, or interactions between other nodes.

-   **Control and Influence**: Nodes with high betweenness centrality have the potential to control the flow of information or resources in the network. They may have more influence or power over the network dynamics compared to other nodes.

We can see that for the top nodes, they are highly interconnected. To the extent that the graph becomes less interpretable.

```{r}
# Assuming you have a function to calculate centrality for each year
calculate_centrality_over_time <- function(nodes, edges, time_unit = "year")
  {
  edges <- edges %>%
    mutate(period = as.Date(paste0(tyear, "-01-01")))
  
  centrality_results <- edges %>%
    group_by(period) %>%
    do({
      current_edges <- .
      current_nodes <- nodes %>% filter(id %in% unique(c(current_edges$source, current_edges$target)))
      graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = current_nodes, edges = current_edges, directed = TRUE)
      graph %>%
        mutate(betweenness = centrality_betweenness()) %>%
        as_tibble() %>%
        summarise(mean_betweenness = mean(betweenness, na.rm = TRUE))
    }) %>%
    ungroup()
  
  return(centrality_results)
}

# Calculate centrality measures over time
centrality_over_time <- calculate_centrality_over_time(mc3_nodes1, mc3_edges)

# Plot centrality measures over time
ggplot(centrality_over_time, aes(x = period, y = mean_betweenness)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Average Betweenness Centrality Per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Mean Betweenness Centrality") +
  theme_minimal()
```

::: callout-note
This graph shows that there is a increasing trend of the average betweenness centrality per year over time.

From around 2000 to 2020, the average betweenness centrality remains relatively low and fluctuates within a small range, indicating a stable network structure during this period. However, starting around 2025, there is a sharp and dramatic increase in the average betweenness centrality.

This sudden rise suggests a significant change in the network dynamics, where certain nodes or entities are becoming increasingly important as bridges or intermediaries connecting different parts of the network. Such a drastic increase could potentially indicate the emergence of new influential players, changes in transaction patterns, or the formation of new connections and pathways within the network.

The rapid growth in average betweenness centrality implies that the network structure is becoming more centralized, with a smaller number of nodes acting as critical hubs or gatekeepers, controlling the flow of information or transactions within the network.
