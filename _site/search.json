    "text": "Q1 methodology\nthe lack of time-series data for each node making it difficult to directly compare changes in corporate structures for the same company over time. Therefore, we simplify our approach by assuming that a company’s structure is proportional to its transaction volume. By grouping transaction data by start date and counting the number of transactions for each period, we can illustrate changes in corporate structures over time. This method allows us to visualize temporal patterns and infer structural changes based on transaction activity.\nTo focus on the most relevant period, we filter the data to only keep transactions from 2000 (five years before 2005) to 2035 (the end of the dataset). This allows us to capture recent changes to entities while excluding older, less relevant data.\nAnother way to observe changes in corporate structures over time is to visualize the changes in the most active people and businesses. By identifying and tracking these key entities, we can gain insights into how their influence and activities shape the overall corporate structure during different periods. This method complements the transaction volume analysis, providing a more comprehensive view of temporal patterns and structural changes."

Figure 2 further illustrates these trends by showing fluctuations in the number of active companies over time. Despite these fluctuations, there is a general upward trend in the number of active companies, particularly from 2010 onwards, where the numbers reach their highest values in the dataset. This pattern mirrors the transaction volume trends observed in Figure 1. Additionally, we notice a dip in the number of active companies around 2035, followed by an increase. This suggests that a significant event may have occurred around 2035, leading to market restructuring."

    "text": "Q2 methodology\nTo address the task of identifying and displaying examples of typical and atypical business transactions, we focused on nodes and edges that signify ownership and employment relationships.\n\nStep 1: Filtering for Relevant Edges\nWe began by filtering the dataset to retain only the edges representing “Event.Owns.Shareholdership,” “Event.WorksFor,” and “Event.Owns.BeneficialOwnership.” These types of edges are crucial for understanding the ownership and employment structures within the corporate network.\n\n\nStep 2: Identifying Suspicious Nodes\nNext, we aimed to identify atypical transactions by leveraging centrality measures. Centrality is a critical metric in network analysis that indicates the importance or influence of a node within the network. We calculated centrality scores for all nodes and then filtered out those below a certain centrality threshold to eliminate false positives.\n\n\nStep 3: Highlighting Suspicious Nodes\nBy applying the centrality threshold, we identified the top 50 suspicious nodes. These nodes, which exhibit unusually high centrality, are indicative of atypical transactions. Their elevated centrality scores suggest that they play a disproportionately influential role in the network, potentially pointing to suspicious or anomalous behavior.\nThrough this method, we can highlight nodes that warrant further investigation and provide insights into the underlying motivations for changes in activity. This analysis helps us identify patterns of influence and ownership that deviate from typical business transactions, thereby uncovering potentially illicit activities within the corporate network."

Here is a summary of our approach:\n\nStep 1: Splitting Nodes and Filtering Edges\nFirst, we split the nodes into two categories: people and companies. We then filtered the dataset to retain only ownership-related edges, such as those representing shareholdership, beneficial ownership, and employment relationships. This step ensures that we focus on the connections that are relevant to understanding influence within the network.\n\n\nStep 2: Identifying Most Influential Individuals (VIPs)\nNext, we determined the most influential individuals by setting a threshold for the number of ownership connections. Individuals who exceed this threshold are considered VIPs, as their numerous ownership connections suggest a higher level of influence within the network.\n\n\n\nnumber of ownership connections\ncount\npercentage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n92\n4\n0.00774\n\n\n\n\n\n\n91\n18\n0.0349\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n1\n0.00194\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n2\n0.00387\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n1\n0.00194\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n2\n0.00387\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n3\n0.00581\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n4\n0.00774\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;= 10\n51594\n99.96\n\n\n\nGiven the significant gap between the top 2 groups and the 3rd, we identified the top 22 individuals (those owning 91 or more companies) as VIPs, as their extensive ownership connections suggest a higher level of influence within the network.\n\n\nStep 3: Filtering Connections Involving Influential Individuals\nFinally, we filtered the ownership connections to include only those involving these 22 influential individuals (VIPs).
